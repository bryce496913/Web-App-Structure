2. Copy the contents of `MainActivity.kt` into the corresponding file in your Android Studio project.
3. Replace the placeholder URL in the `url` variable with your desired website URL.
4. Customize the app title by updating the `setTitle` method in the code.

### iOS

1. Open Xcode and create a new project.
2. Copy the contents of `ContentView.swift` into the corresponding file in your Xcode project.
3. Replace the placeholder URL in the `webView` initialization with your desired website URL.
4. Customize the app title by updating the `navigationBarTitle` modifier in the code.
